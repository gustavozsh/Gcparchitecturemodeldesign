# Google Cloud Architecture Design Model (Figma)

This repository contains a Google Cloud architecture design model created in Figma. It is intended as a visual reference and supporting material for architecture and data engineering activities — such as workshops, presentations, solution planning, and technical documentation. This is not executable code nor an official Google Cloud product.

## What this is
- A visual design model for Google Cloud architecture, developed using Figma.
- Meant to help architecture and data engineering teams communicate high-level decisions, data flows, and infrastructure components.
- May include diagrams, exported assets (images/SVG), and explanatory notes that accompany the design.

## Intended uses
- Solution and data architecture planning for Google Cloud.
- Design sessions, reviews, workshops, and presentations to stakeholders.
- Conceptual documentation of data pipelines, storage, processing, and orchestration components.
- A starting point to adapt into project-specific architectures.

## Limitations and disclaimers
- This is a visual design template — it does not include deployable infrastructure (no IaC templates, scripts, or runnable services).
- This is not official Google Cloud guidance. Use it as a reference and validate all architecture decisions against current requirements, cost considerations, security policies, and best practices.
- Update and adapt diagrams before making production decisions.

## How to use this repository
1. Open the associated Figma file (if a link is provided in the repository) to edit the model directly.
2. Use the export assets (PNG/SVG) in your documents, slide decks, or technical documentation.
3. Add notes in Figma or supplementary files in the repository to record architectural decisions and trade-offs.
4. If you want to turn the design into infrastructure, convert components into IaC templates (e.g., Terraform, Deployment Manager) and validate them appropriately.

## First steps

This is a code bundle for Google Cloud Architecture Model. The original project is available at [it's a secret, for a while rs].

## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
